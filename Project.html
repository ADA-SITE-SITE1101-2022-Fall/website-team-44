        <p>Hour of Code event 
            Let's revisit this wonderful day, November 15, and remember it. We held our "Hours of Code" event at Sumgayit Secondary School No. 11 as team number 44. Our team members and class 8A1 collaborated to make the session more enjoyable and effective. Literally, their eagerness made us too excited to speak with as well as help them.
            
            Following an introduction to ADA University, we present thorough information on our faculty, programming languages, and Code.org. Then we began doing the activities with the students. All of the tasks were accomplished in 20 minutes because of their quickness and intelligence. At the conclusion, we awarded them certificates for their performance.
