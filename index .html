        <p class="p2">Did you wonder why we are known as the "Welfare Team"?</p>
        <p class="p3">Happiness and self-confidence from learning new things are our welfare. To avoid disbandment, we trusted each other and united without knowing each other personally or having individual skills. This welfare gave us the power of the phrase "Everyone can achieve anything if they truly want to. "Which is the basis for Team 44 and its projects. We are excited to share our entire journey with you via our latest project.</p>
